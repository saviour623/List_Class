Lets transform array to be like
ARRAY(list, U(1, 2, 4), F(2.0, 3.9, 4.6), D(1.45, 2.556, 3.3))
do we will have something like
P_U check(unsigned ...)
P_F check(float ...)
if no identifier
P_1(typeof ...)


/* TODO: check for array((1, and )1,

/*we check for { in arg. if braces exist, we find a way to remove the final braces and paste the arguments while doing that we check for the type of the any of the arguments, and finally we paste the the finally list, the do the same for __VA_ARGS__}

you can pass in i0, to tell that all the elements are of the same type
e.g D(i0, ...)
#def i0 i, 0

/** documentation:
ARRAY
array must be bounded with parenthesis and must have members
first arhument must be an object 
array must not be called with an empty argument
if two empty argumwnt will prematurely end the array
empty array will yeild warning

* ARRAY_ARGS: Recursively checks for arguments: 
1. if arguments: check for parenthesis by assertion. assertion takes three arguments, the error signal, the current argument and: if there is parenthesis the final argument goes to the next stage, else, it expands to the arguments after the current argument which would be used by the assertion for logging error. Now if the assertion is true, the parenthesis is checked for arguments using the same assertion technique above. if true, it creates an array by calling CONSTRUCT ARRAY else it expands to the post arguments for logging error.
2. else if the current argument is empty: if the next argument has values, an error is raised for initializing an empty array. else the  end of array creation.

at clst_init_list, array should choose either type or typeof the first argument depending if type was provided. however instead of using an obvious typeof, lets use the already typedef made earlier

also at ARRAY, init, array should append * type to make the compound literal valid by making it a literal of pointer of array to the members. e.g type=int
then we should have sizeof type (if non array) and sizeof type* (if array).
